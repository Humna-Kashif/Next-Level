routes.js requires installing react-router-dom for switching between different routes
npm i react-router-dom --force

now we need to place our components inside switch tag except navbar, sidebars and footer.

after that install react-bootstrap or any other libarary you want to use for styling or grid system
I have used react-bootstrap initially

npm i react-bootstrap --force
